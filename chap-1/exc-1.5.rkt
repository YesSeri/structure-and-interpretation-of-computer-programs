(define (p)(p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
; The expression becomes:
; (if (= 0 0)
;     0
;     p))
; Which turns into:
; (test 0 (p))
; or
; (if #t 0 p)
;
; In applicative order,first one the arguments p keeps getting repeated,
; in the second one it terminates immediately.
